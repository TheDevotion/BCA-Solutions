OOP's
1.OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
2.It is a programming style and fashion that reduce repetation, and increase readability of the program.
3.concepts :-
	1.data abstraction :-
		1.Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of data and showing only the essential features or interface to the outside world
		2.key features :- hide complex details, interface, modularity, enhance security

	2.encalsulation. :- 
		1.is the wrapping of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).	
		2. in simple term it means bundling data and functions into a one unit.
		3. CPP uses class for encapsulation
		4. features :- modularity, security, efficiency
		
	3.inheritance :- 
		1. means the accessing methods and properties of base class into the derived class.
		2. inheritance is a concept allows to access the methods and properties of the parent class to his child class.
		3.types of inheritance :-
			1.single 2.multiple. 3.multilevel 4.hierarchical 5.hybrid
		3.syntax
		4.example
		5.explanation

	4.polymorphism :-
		1.is a combination of two words poly means one name and morphism means many form so polymorphism means one name many forms
		2.types of polymorphism:-
			1.Compile time polymorphism :-
				1.it decide which function should call on the based of function argument,no of arguments at a compile time.
				2.it achieve through the 1.function overloading, 2.operator overloading
			2.run time :-
				1.it decide which function should get call at a run time.
				2.it uses virtual function to achive the runtime polymorphism.

	1.reusability
	2.flexibility
	3.efficiency
5.feature :-
	1.class and object
	2.encapsulation
