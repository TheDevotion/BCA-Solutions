1.This pointer:-
1.is a special pointer that points to the current object instance
2.allows to access data member and properties within the current object.
3.this pointer help to solve ambiguity.
4. example


2.virtual function :- 
1.it used to override the member function of the derived class.
2.it declare with the member function of base class with keyword 'virtual'. 
3.syntax
4.example
5.explanation


3. pure virtual function :-
1.is a virtual function that is declared in a base class but has no implementation in the base class. Instead, it is overrided in derived classes.
2.the base class member function is declared with the 'virtual' keyword.
3.syntax
4.example
5.explanation

4. Pointer to object :-
1.is a class pointer that hold the memory address of object
2.it allows indirect access of object
3. example
4.explanation


5. Early binding :- 
1.It is also known as static binding or compile-time binding
2.refers to the process of associating a function call with its corresponding function definition during compile time
3. It used in a function overloading
4. example
5.explanation

 
6. Late binding :-
1.also known as dynamic binding or runtime binding
2.refers to the process of associating a function call or variable reference with its corresponding implementation or value during runtime
3.example 
4. explanation
